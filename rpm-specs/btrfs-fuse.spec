%description
This is a read-only btrfs implementation using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).

Although btrfs is already in mainline Linux kernel, there are still use-cases
for such read-only btrfs implementation:
- Educational purpose: let new developers get a quick way to learn how a
  complex and modern filesystem works;
- For certain bootloaders: certain bootloaders need code base compatible with
  their license;
- As a last resort method for subpage/multipage support: currently (v5.16-rc)
  the Linux kernel can only support sectorsize == pagesize , and 4K sectorsize
  with 64K page size; thus this project can act as a last resort method to read
  data from filesystem with unsupported sectorsize.
