%description
C->Haskell assists in the development of Haskell bindings to C libraries.
It extracts interface information from C header files and generates Haskell
code with foreign imports and marshaling. Unlike writing foreign imports by
hand (or using hsc2hs), this ensures that C functions are imported with the
correct Haskell types.
