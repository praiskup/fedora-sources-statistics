%description
CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB).
The goal of CGDB is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with
unnecessary features.
The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text interface,
with a split screen showing the source as it executes.
The UI is modeled on the classic Unix text editor, vi.
Those familiar with vi should feel right at home using CGDB.
