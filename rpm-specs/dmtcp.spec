# This package is functional only on i386, x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.
# It should also work on %%ix86, but Koji seems to have problems with it.
## We're excluding aarch64 for now, because we don't have a trampoline for it.
## In the next relase, we won't need the trampoline.  We'll interpose
##   entirely on pthread_create, and not on __clone3

%description
DMTCP is a tool to transparently checkpoint the state of multiple simultaneous
applications, including multi-threaded and distributed applications. It operates
directly on the user binary executable, without any Linux kernel modules or
other kernel modifications.

Among the applications supported by DMTCP are MPI (various implementations),
OpenMP, MATLAB, Python, Perl, R, and many programming languages and shell
scripting languages. DMTCP also supports GNU screen sessions, including
vim/cscope and emacs. With the use of TightVNC, it can also checkpoint and
restart X Window applications. For a multilib (mixture of 32- and 64-bit
processes), see "./configure --enable-multilib".

DMTCP supports the commonly used OFED API for InfiniBand, as well as its
integration with various implementations of MPI, and resource managers (e.g.,
SLURM).

This package contains DMTCP binaries.
