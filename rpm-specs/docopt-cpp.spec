%global common_description %{expand:docopt creates beautiful command-line interfaces

Isn't it awesome how getopt (and boost::program_options for you fancy folk!)
generate help messages based on your code?! These timeless functions have been
around for decades and have proven we don't need anything better, right?

Hell no! You know what's awesome? It's when the option parser is generated
based on the beautiful help message that you write yourself! This way you
don't need to write this stupid repeatable parser-code, and instead can
write only the help message-the way you want it.

%description
%{common_description}
This is a port of the docopt.py module (https://github.com/docopt/docopt),
and we have tried to maintain full feature parity (and code structure)
as the original.

This port is written in C++11 and also requires a good C++11 standard library
(in particular, one with regex support).
