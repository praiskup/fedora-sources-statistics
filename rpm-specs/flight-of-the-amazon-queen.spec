%description
It is 1949 and you play Joe King, pilot for hire with his small private plane
the 'Amazon Queen'. The game is a spoof of old timey radio adventure serials,
and as it begins we find Joe in one of those typical situations. It is 11:58
and 36 seconds and counting, Joe and his date are tied up in an abandoned
warehouse ("you really know how to show a girl a good time, Joe!"), and a bomb
is set to go off at midnight!

Of course they escape, in the nick of time, and immediately set us up for the
next 'adventure'. Joe suddenly remembers that he is scheduled to fly the famous
movie star, Faye Russell, to a photo shoot in the Amazon jungle the next
morning.

Notice that this package contains the floppy version, the CD version is also
available in the %{name}-cd package. The CD version contains
additional / longer cutscenes and voice acting, but also is much larger: the CD
version ways in at 37 MB where as this version is only 7 MB.
