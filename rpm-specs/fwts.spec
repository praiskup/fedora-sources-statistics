%description
Firmware Test Suite (FWTS) is a test suite that performs sanity checks on
Intel/AMD PC firmware. It is intended to identify BIOS and ACPI errors and if
appropriate it will try to explain the errors and give advice to help
workaround or fix firmware bugs. It is primarily intended to be a Linux-specific
firmware troubleshooting tool.
