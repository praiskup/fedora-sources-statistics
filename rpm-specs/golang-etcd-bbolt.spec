%global common_description %{expand:
Package Bbolt implements a low-level key/value store in pure Go. It supports
fully serializable transactions, ACID semantics, and lock-free MVCC with
multiple readers and a single writer. Bolt can be used for projects that want a
simple data store without the need to add large dependencies such as Postgres or
MySQL.

Bolt is a single-level, zero-copy, B+tree data store. This means that Bolt is
optimized for fast read access and does not require recovery in the event of a
system crash. Transactions which have not finished committing will simply be
rolled back in the event of a crash.

The design of Bolt is based on Howard Chu's LMDB database project.}
