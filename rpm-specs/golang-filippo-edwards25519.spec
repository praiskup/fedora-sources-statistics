%global common_description %{expand:
This library implements the edwards25519 elliptic curve, exposing the necessary
APIs to build a wide array of higher-level primitives.

The code is originally derived from Adam Langley's internal implementation in
the Go standard library, and includes George Tankersley's performance
improvements. It was then further developed by Henry de Valence for use in
ristretto255, and was finally merged back into the Go standard library as of Go
1.17. It now tracks the upstream codebase and extends it with additional
functionality.}
