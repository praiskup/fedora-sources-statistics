%global common_description %{expand:
Simple-scrypt provides a convenience wrapper around Go's existing scrypt
package that makes it easier to securely derive strong keys ("hash user
passwords"). This library allows you to:

 - Generate a scrypt derived key with a crytographically secure salt and sane
default parameters for N, r and p.
 - Upgrade the parameters used to generate keys as hardware improves by storing
them with the derived key (the scrypt spec. doesn't allow for this by default).
 - Provide your own parameters (if you wish to).

The API closely mirrors Go's bcrypt library in an effort to make it easy to
migrateâ€”and because it's an easy to grok API.}
