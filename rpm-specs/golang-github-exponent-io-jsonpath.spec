%global common_description %{expand:
This package extends the json.Decoder to support navigating a stream of JSON
tokens. You should be able to use this extended Decoder places where a
json.Decoder would have been used.

This Decoder has the following enhancements:
 - The Scan method supports scanning a JSON stream while extracting particular
   values along the way using PathActions.
 - The SeekTo method supports seeking forward in a JSON token stream to a
   particular path.
 - The Path method returns the path of the most recently parsed token.
 - The Token method has been modified to distinguish between strings that are
   object keys and strings that are values. Object key strings are returned as
   the KeyString type rather than a native string.}
