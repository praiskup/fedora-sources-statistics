%global common_description %{expand:
Structs contains various utilities to work with Go structs. It was initially
used by me to convert a struct into a map[string]interface{}. With time I've
added other utilities for structs. It's basically a high level package based on
primitives from the reflect package. Feel free to add new functions or improve
the existing code.}
