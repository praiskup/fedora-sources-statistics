%global common_description %{expand:
Complete and usable DNS library. All Resource Records are supported, including
the DNSSEC types. It follows a lean and mean philosophy. If there is stuff you
should know as a DNS programmer there isn't a convenience function for it.
Server side and client side programming is supported, i.e. you can build servers
and resolvers with it.}
