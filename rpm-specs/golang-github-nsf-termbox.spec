%global common_description %{expand:
Termbox is a library that provides a minimalistic API which allows the
programmer to write text-based user interfaces. The library is crossplatform and
has both terminal-based implementations on *nix operating systems and a winapi
console based implementation for windows operating systems. The basic idea is an
abstraction of the greatest common subset of features available on all major
terminals and other terminal-like APIs in a minimalistic fashion. Small API
means it is easy to implement, test, maintain and learn it, that's what makes
the termbox a distinct library in its area.}
