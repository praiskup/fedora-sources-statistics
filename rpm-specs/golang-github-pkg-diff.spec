%global common_description %{expand:
Module github.com/pkg/diff can be used to create, modify, and print diffs.

The top level package, diff, contains convenience functions for the most common
uses.

The subpackages provide very fine-grained control over every aspect:
- myers: creates diffs using the Myers diff algorithm.
- edit: contains the core diff data types.
- ctxt: provides tools to reduce the amount of context in a diff.
- write: provides routines to write diffs in standard formats.}
