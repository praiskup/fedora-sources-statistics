%global common_description %{expand: Boiler-plate to securely seed Go's random
number generator (if possible). This library isn't anything fancy, it's just a
canonical way of seeding Go's random number generator. Cribbed from Nomad before
it was moved into Consul and made into a helper function, and now further
modularized to be a super lightweight and reusable library.}
