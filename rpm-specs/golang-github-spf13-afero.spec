%global common_description %{expand:
Afero is an filesystem framework providing a simple, uniform and universal API
interacting with any filesystem, as an abstraction layer providing interfaces,
types and methods. Afero has an exceptionally clean interface and simple design
without needless constructors or initialization methods.

Afero is also a library providing a base set of interoperable backend
filesystems that make it easy to work with afero while retaining all the power
and benefit of the os and ioutil packages.

Afero provides significant improvements over using the os package alone, most
notably the ability to create mock and testing filesystems without relying on
the disk.

It is suitable for use in a any situation where you would consider using the OS
package as it provides an additional abstraction that makes it easy to use a
memory backed file system during testing. It also adds support for the http
filesystem for full interoperability.}
