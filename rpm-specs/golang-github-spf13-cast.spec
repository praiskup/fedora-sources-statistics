%global common_description %{expand:
Cast is a library to convert between different go types in a consistent and easy
way.

Cast provides simple functions to easily convert a number to a string, an
interface into a bool, etc. Cast does this intelligently when an obvious
conversion is possible. It doesn’t make any attempts to guess what you meant,
for example you can only convert a string to an int when it is a string
representation of an int such as “8”. Cast was developed for use in Hugo, a
website engine which uses YAML, TOML or JSON for meta data.}
