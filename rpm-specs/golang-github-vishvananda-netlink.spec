%global common_description %{expand:
The netlink package provides a simple netlink library for Go. Netlink is the
interface a user-space program in linux uses to communicate with the kernel. It
can be used to add and remove interfaces, set ip addresses and routes, and
configure ipsec. Netlink communication requires elevated privileges, so in most
cases this code needs to be run as root. Since low-level netlink messages are
inscrutable at best, the library attempts to provide an api that is loosely
modeled on the CLI provided by iproute2. Actions like ip link add will be
accomplished via a similarly named function like AddLink(). This library began
its life as a fork of the netlink functionality in docker/libcontainer but was
heavily rewritten to improve testability, performance, and to add new
functionality like ipsec xfrm handling.}
