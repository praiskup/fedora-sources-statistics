%global common_description %{expand:
Blackfriday is a Markdown processor implemented in Go. It is paranoid about its
input (so you can safely feed it user-supplied data), it is fast, it supports
common extensions (tables, smart punctuation substitutions, etc.), and it is
safe for all utf-8 (unicode) input.

HTML output is currently supported, along with Smartypants extensions.}
