%global common_description %{expand:
The yaml package enables Go programs to comfortably encode and decode YAML
values. It was developed within Canonical as part of the juju project, and is
based on a pure Go port of the well-known libyaml C library to parse and
generate YAML data quickly and reliably.

The yaml package supports most of YAML 1.1 and 1.2, including support for
anchors, tags, map merging, etc. Multi-document unmarshalling is not yet
implemented, and base-60 floats from YAML 1.1 are purposefully not supported
since they're a poor design and are gone in YAML 1.2.}
