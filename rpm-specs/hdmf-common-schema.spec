%description
The HDMF Common specification defines a collection of common, reusable data
structures that build the foundation for the modeling of advanced data formats,
e.g., the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) (https://www.nwb.org/)
neurophysiology data standard. The HDMF Common schema is integrated with HDMF
(https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf), which provides advanced APIs for reading,
writing, and using HDMF-common data types.

# We could build and install the associated documentation, but we would have to
# package python-hdmf-docutils to do so.
#
# Note that we would need to build PDF documentation, as Sphinx-generated HTML
# documentation is not suitable for packaging; see
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006555, the linked devel mailing
# list thread, and https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/pull-request/1244, for
# discussion.
#
# Overall, it doesnâ€™t seem worthwhile.
#
# If we are not building documentation, then there is nothing to build.


%install
# There is no build-system script or standard install location for the schemas.
