%description
Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) is the most popular parser generator for use
with Java applications. A parser generator is a tool that reads a grammar
specification and converts it to a Java program that can recognize matches to
the grammar. In addition to the parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other
standard capabilities related to parser generation such as tree building (via
a tool called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions, debugging, etc.
