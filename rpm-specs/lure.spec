%description
Lure of the Temptress was Revolution's very first adventure game and work began
on it in 1989, even before Revolution's inception as an actual games
development company. From the start our aim was to consider the contemporary
adventures of the day and then bring something new to the genre. From this came
the Virtual Theatre engine. VT allowed in-game characters to wander around the
gameworld indepently of each other, living their own lives and doing their own
thing. Another feature allowed the player to give direct orders to Helper
characters - in this case Ratpouch - who would then go off to perform the task.

The result is a quirky and entertaining adventure game that kicked off
Revolution's fondness for characterisation and in-game humour.
