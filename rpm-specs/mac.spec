%description
Monkey's Audio is a fast and easy way to compress digital music. Unlike
traditional methods such as mp3, ogg, or lqt that permanently discard
quality to save space, Monkey's Audio only makes perfect, bit-for-bit
copies of your music. That means it always sounds perfect â€“ exactly the
same as the original. Even though the sound is perfect, it still saves a
lot of space.
