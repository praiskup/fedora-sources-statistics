%description
A portable, utilizing OpenGL and SDL, argument(command-line)-driven multi-system
emulator. Mednafen has the ability to remap hotkey functions and virtual system
inputs to a keyboard, a joystick, or both simultaneously. Save states are
supported, as is real-time game rewinding. Screen snapshots may be taken, in the
PNG file format, at the press of a button. Mednafen can record audiovisual
movies in the QuickTime file format, with several different lossless codecs
supported.

The following systems are supported(refer to the emulation module documentation
for more details):

* Apple II/II+
* Atari Lynx
* Neo Geo Pocket (Color)
* WonderSwan
* GameBoy (Color)
* GameBoy Advance
* Nintendo Entertainment System
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom
* Virtual Boy
* PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 (CD)
* SuperGrafx
* PC-FX
* Sega Game Gear
* Sega Genesis/Megadrive
* Sega Master System
* Sega Saturn (experimental, x86_64 only)
* Sony PlayStation

Due to the threaded model of emulation used in Mednafen, and limitations of SDL,
a joystick is preferred over a keyboard to play games, as the joystick will have
slightly less latency, although the latency differences may not be perceptible
to most people.
