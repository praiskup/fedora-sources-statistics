%description
MultiMarkdown is a superset of the Markdown lightweight markup syntax with
support for additional output formats and features.

Writing with MultiMarkdown allows you to separate the content and structure of
your document from the formatting. You focus on the actual writing, without
having to worry about making the styles of your chapter headers match, or
ensuring the proper spacing between paragraphs. And with a little forethought, a
single plain text document can easily be converted into multiple output formats
without having to rewrite the entire thing or format it by hand. Even better,
you don’t have to write in “computer-ese” to create well formatted HTML or LaTeX
commands. You just write, MultiMarkdown takes care of the rest.
