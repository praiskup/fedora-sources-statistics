%description
Base is a standard library for OCaml.  It provides a standard set of
general purpose modules that are well-tested, performant, and
fully-portable across any environment that can run OCaml code.  Unlike
other standard library projects, Base is meant to be used as a wholesale
replacement of the standard library distributed with the OCaml compiler.
In particular it makes different choices and doesn't re-export features
that are not fully portable such as I/O, which are left to other
libraries.
