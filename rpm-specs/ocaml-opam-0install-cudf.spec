%description
Opam's default solver is designed to maintain a set of packages over time,
minimizing disruption when installing new programs and finding a compromise
solution across all packages (e.g. avoiding upgrading some library to prevent
uninstalling another program).

In many situations (e.g. a CI system building in a clean environment, a
project-local opam root, or a duniverse build) this is not necessary, and we
can get a solution much faster by using a different algorithm.

This package provides a generic solver library which uses 0install's solver
library.  The CUDF library is used in order to interface with opam as it is
the format used to talk to the supported solvers.
