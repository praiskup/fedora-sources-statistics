Name:           opentype-sanitizer
# The following dependent packages have their versions kept in sync with
# opentype-sanitizer, and should be updated at the same time, ideally as a
# multi-build update (i.e., using a side tag).
#
# - python-opentype-sanitizer
Version:        9.2.0
Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        Parses and serializes OpenType/WOFF/WOFF2 font files

# Some test fonts (even after filtering out those that are not freely
# redistributable—see below) have other acceptable licenses, such as OFL-1.1 or
# Bitstream-Vera, and certain build-system files are MIT-licensed; but none are
# installed, so they do not affect the license field of the package.
License:        BSD-3-Clause
URL:            https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots
# This is generated from the upstream tarball (ots-%%{version}.tar.gz) by
# get-source.py, which excludes test fonts that are not redistributable.
Source0:        ots-%{version}-filtered.tar.xz
# Usage: ./get-source.py VERSION
#
# Requires python3, python3-requests, python3-tqdm, and python3-fonttools.
#
# Some test fonts have unknown or restrictive licenses and cannot be
# redistributed in Fedora. We could remove all the test fonts, but the
# more-sophisticated approach in this script allows us to keep as many test
# fonts as possible:
#   1. Fonts with restrictive distributability metadata (fstype in the OS2
#      section) are filtered out.
#   2. Fonts with known-good licenses are included.
#   3. Fonts that have been manually audited for distributability can be
#      recorded in the script source so that they are always included or always
#      filtered out
#   4. Fonts not accepted or rejected in 1–3 above are filtered out as a
#      precaution, and manual auditing is suggested to the script user.
Source1:        get-source.py
# This is also generated from Source1. Since test fonts are now manually
# specified in the meson files, we must patch out those that have been removed.
# This file, a list of SHA1 checksums (which correspond to filenames) makes
# that possible.

# The source package includes several dozen sample “good” fonts to provide a
# minimal set of functional tests. To more thoroughly test “good” fonts,
# HowToTest.md says, “install as many as possible TrueType and OpenType fonts.”
# Rather than adding a huge list of BR’s on arbitrary fonts, and trying to
# ensure that the tests find them, we consider that the bundled “good” fonts
# are adequate for validating the package build (as opposed to developing
# opentype-sanitizer itself).

%global common_description %{expand:
The OpenType Sanitizer (OTS) parses and serializes OpenType files (OTF, TTF)
and WOFF and WOFF2 font files, validating them and sanitizing them as it goes.

The C library is integrated into Chromium and Firefox, and also simple command
line tools to check files offline in a Terminal.

The CSS font-face property is great for web typography. Having to use images in
order to get the correct typeface is a great sadness; one should be able to use
vectors.

However, on many platforms the system-level TrueType font renderers have never
been part of the attack surface before, and putting them on the front line is a
scary proposition... Especially on platforms like Windows, where it’s a
closed-source blob running with high privilege.}
