# We used to choose to install the Markdown documentation sources, as they are

# really worthwile.

%description
pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in
Python. It’s roughly similar to macOS’s brew, JavaScript’s npx, and Linux’s
apt.

It’s closely related to pip. In fact, it uses pip, but is focused on installing
and managing Python packages that can be run from the command line directly as
applications.

# Generate shell completions. “pipx completions” says:
#
# Add the appropriate command to your shell's config file
# so that it is run on startup. You will likely have to restart
# or re-login for the autocompletion to start working.
#
# bash:
#     eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pipx)"
#
# zsh:
#     To activate completions for zsh you need to have
#     bashcompinit enabled in zsh:
#
#     autoload -U bashcompinit
#     bashcompinit
#
#     Afterwards you can enable completion for pipx:
#
#     eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pipx)"
#
# tcsh:
#     eval `register-python-argcomplete --shell tcsh pipx`
#
# fish:
#     # Not required to be in the config file, only run once
#     register-python-argcomplete --shell fish pipx >~/.config/fish/completions/pipx.fish
for sh in bash tcsh fish
do
  # We don’t need to be able to import pipx for this command to work.

# It’s just not practical to run the tests. For most of them, we need either
# (by default) a bundle of sample wheels from PyPI–which is arch-specific, as
# some of them have compiled extensions—or network access. Previously, we tried
# to disentangle the tests that did not require PyPI packages, but this has
# become onerous.
#
# Instead, we “smoke-test” the installation by running the command-line tool
# and confirming it can print its help output without crashing.

# Make sure the source copy of the package is not in the Python path.
