Version:        1.3.0
Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        R-Tree spatial index for Python GIS

# Since the package has a history of arch-dependent bugs (see RHBZ#2055249),
# the base package is arched to flush out any arch-dependent bugs by ensuring
# the tests are run on every architecture. The binary package is still
# pure-Python and correctly noarch. Since there is no compiled code, there is
# no debuginfo to generate.

%global _description %{expand:
Rtree is a ctypes Python wrapper of libspatialindex that provides a number of
advanced spatial indexing features for the spatially curious Python user. These
features include:

  • Nearest neighbor search
  • Intersection search
  • Multi-dimensional indexes
  • Clustered indexes (store Python pickles directly with index entries)
  • Bulk loading
  • Deletion
  • Disk serialization
  • Custom storage implementation (to implement spatial indexing in ZODB, for
    example)}

# Treat as pure Python since libspatialindex is not bundled
#
# Since we are not bundling libspatialindex as upstream does for PyPI wheel
# distribution, do not force setuptools to treat the package as binary/arched
# (which would cause it to be installed in %%python3_sitearch, and would mean
# this package could not properly be noarch).
#
# Since upstream does want to bundle libspatialindex, this is a downstream-only
# patch.
