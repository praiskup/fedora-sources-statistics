# Since we cannot run the full upstream test suite (see comments below), we
# start with the implicit default import “smoke test.” Then:
%check -a
# Upstream provides some “smoke tests” that we can run, too. We cannot use the
# wrapper smoke_tests/smoke_test.sh because it downloads things from the
# Internet, but we can run the Python scripts manually.
%{py3_test_envvars} %{python3} smoke_tests/sample_app.py --echo smoke 2>&1 |
  grep -F 'echo is smoke.'
%{py3_test_envvars} %{python3} smoke_tests/sample_test.py |
  grep -Fq 'msg_for_test'

# Running the actual test suite requires bazel, which will almost certainly
# never be packaged for Fedora due to its Byzantine mass of bundled
# dependencies. It is possible to invoke the tests with another runner, such as
# pytest, but there are many spurious failures due to the incorrect
# environment, so it is useless to do so.
