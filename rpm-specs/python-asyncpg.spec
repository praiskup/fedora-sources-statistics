# Note that asyncpg/pgproto comes from a git submodule referencing a separate
# project, https://github.com/MagicStack/py-pgproto. However, we do not treat
# it as a bundled dependency because it contains only sources; it has no build
# system and is not designed for separate installation; and it is managed as a
# part of the asyncpg package, as evidenced by the comment “This module is part
# of asyncpg” in the file headers.

%global common_description %{expand:
asyncpg is a database interface library designed specifically for PostgreSQL
and Python/asyncio. asyncpg is an efficient, clean implementation of PostgreSQL
server binary protocol for use with Python’s asyncio framework. You can read
more about asyncpg in an introductory blog post
http://magic.io/blog/asyncpg-1m-rows-from-postgres-to-python/.}

# It is not clear why the tests always import asyncpg as ../asyncpg/__init__.py
# even if we set PYTHONPATH to the installed sitearch directory. This
# workaround is ugly, but there is nothing actually wrong with it, as the
# install is already done by the time the check section runs:
rm -rf asyncpg
