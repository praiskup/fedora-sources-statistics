# Currently, all tests require network access. Furthermore, of the three
# supported package managers (mamba, conda, and micromamba), the one used for
# the tests is mamba, and this is the only one that is not currently packaged.
# We therefore cannot even run the tests in a local mock build with
# --enable-network unless we patch them to use a different package manager.
