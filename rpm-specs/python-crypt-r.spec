%global _description %{expand:
The crypt_r module is a renamed copy of the crypt module as it was present in
Python 3.12 before it was removed.

See PEP 594 for details of the removal.

Unlike crypt, this library always exposes the crypt_r(3) function, not crypt(3).

This module implements an interface to the crypt_r(3) routine, which is
a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; see the Unix man
page for further details. Possible uses include storing hashed passwords so you
can check passwords without storing the actual password, or attempting to crack
Unix passwords with a dictionary.}
