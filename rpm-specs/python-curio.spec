%global common_description %{expand:
Curio is a coroutine-based library for concurrent Python systems programming
using async/await. It provides standard programming abstractions such as tasks,
sockets, files, locks, and queues as well as some advanced features such as
support for structured concurrency. It works on Unix and Windows and has zero
dependencies. You will find it to be familiar, small, fast, and fun.}
