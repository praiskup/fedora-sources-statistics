Version:        0.1.9
Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        Wrapper around the Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification library

License:        MIT
URL:            https://github.com/pyvista/fast-simplification
# The GitHub archive contains many ancillary files, like the README, the
# examples, and the list of test requirements, that the PyPI sdist lacks.
Source:         %{url}/archive/v%{version}/fast-simplification-%{version}.tar.gz

# Downstream-only: do not override system compiler flags
# 
# Don’t compile with -O3 unless we can point to benchmarks that justify it.
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_compiler_flags
Patch:          0001-Downstream-only-do-not-override-system-compiler-flag.patch
# Downstream-only: allow building with numpy 1.x
#    
# We believe upstream requires numpy 2.x only so that they can build binary
# distributions compatible with both 2.x and 1.x for PyPI.
#
# See discussion in https://github.com/pyvista/fast-simplification/issues/38.

%global common_description %{expand:
This is a python wrapping of the Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification Library
(https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification/). Having arrived
at the same problem as the original author, but needing a Python library, this
project seeks to extend the work of the original library while adding
integration to Python and the PyVista (https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista)
project.

Summary:        %{summary}

# The source file fast_simplification/Simplify.h is based on src.cmd/Simplify.h
# from https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification, which is
# not currently packaged. It does not make sense to attempt to unbundle this,
# because:
#
#   - The Simplify.h header is part of the implementation of a command-line
#     tool, and is not designed to be used as a library
#   - Changes have been made for this project, e.g.
#     https://github.com/pyvista/fast-simplification/commit/d55a7dcf2066099e3efe341d201b9c5ab22b100a.
#     Normally we would ask our upstream to offer these to the original project
#     so that they could eventually return to using it unmodified, but since
#     the copied and forked header is not really a library, and the changes
#     aren’t relevant to the command-line tool it supports, this doesn’t make
#     sense.
#
# The version was determined by careful inspection of sources and commit
# history; the changes from 4aeffce360279bd070492487426f3e6715c22562 are
# present, but those from the following commit
# f958f696c05b4b7a18ca85bc5c89d4f8e60288ad are not.
