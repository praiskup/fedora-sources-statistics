# Downstream-only: Build normal wheels in-place
#
# Upstream wants to build only editable wheels in-place, building normal
# wheels in a temporary directory. This is reasonable in principle, but
# the implementation conflicts with the pyproject-rpm-macros, resulting in
# an unbounded recursion of nested temporary directories.
Patch:          0001-Downstream-only-Build-normal-wheels-in-place.patch

# Work around the failing test in Python 3.13+ - skip the new
# __static_attributes__ and __firstlineno__ methods
# Reported upstream: https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/588
Patch:          Skip-some-attributes-when-testing.patch
