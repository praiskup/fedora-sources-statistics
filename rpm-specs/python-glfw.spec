%global _description %{expand:
This module provides Python bindings for GLFW (on GitHub: glfw/glfw).
It is a ctypes wrapper which keeps very close to the original GLFW API,
except for:

- function names use the pythonic `words_with_underscores` notation
  instead of `camelCase`
- `GLFW_` and `glfw` prefixes have been removed, as their function is
  replaced by the module namespace (you can use `from glfw.GLFW import *`
  if you prefer the naming convention used by the GLFW C API)
- structs have been replaced with Python sequences and namedtuples
- functions like `glfwGetMonitors` return a list instead of a pointer
  and an object count
- Gamma ramps use floats between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of unsigned shorts
  (use `glfw.NORMALIZE_GAMMA_RAMPS=False` to disable this)
- GLFW errors are reported as glfw.GLFWError warnings if no error
  callback is set (use `glfw.ERROR_REPORTING=False` to disable this,
  set it to `warn` instead to issue warnings, set it to `log` to log it
  using the `glfw` logger or set it to a dict to define the behavior
  for specific error codes)
- instead of a sequence for `GLFWimage` structs, PIL/pillow `Image`
  objects can be used}
