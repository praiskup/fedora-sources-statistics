%global _description %{expand:
This Python package provides high level utilities to read/write a variety of
Python types to/from HDF5 (Heirarchal Data Format) formatted files. This
package also provides support for MATLAB MAT v7.3 formatted files, which are
just HDF5 files with a different extension and some extra meta-data.

All of this is done without pickling data. Pickling is bad for security because
it allows arbitrary code to be executed in the interpreter. One wants to be
able to read possibly HDF5 and MAT files from untrusted sources, so pickling is
avoided in this package.

The package's documetation is found at http://pythonhosted.org/hdf5storage/
