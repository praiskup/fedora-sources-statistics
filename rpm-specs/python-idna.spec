%description
A library to support the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
protocol as specified in RFC 5891 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>.  This
version of the protocol is often referred to as "IDNA2008" and can produce
different results from the earlier standard from 2003.

The library is also intended to act as a suitable drop-in replacement for the
"encodings.idna" module that comes with the Python standard library but
currently only supports the older 2003 specification.
