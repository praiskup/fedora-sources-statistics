# We cannot generate BR’s from the “optional” extra because some of the
# dependencies that are added are not packaged. This also applies to the
# “tests” extra.i See imblearn/_min_dependencies.py for the actual definitions
# of extras and for minimum versions of dependencies. However, we still want
# any dependencies (other than coverage analysis, linters, etc.) that *are*
# available for testing, so we add them manually:

# optionals, docs, examples, tests:
BuildRequires:  python3dist(pandas) >= 1.0.5
# Not packaged:
# BuildRequires:  python3dist(keras) >= 2.4.3
# BuildRequires:  python3dist(tensorflow) >= 2.4.3

# tests
BuildRequires:  python3dist(pytest) >= 5.0.1
# Dependencies such as pytest-cov, flake8, black, and mypy are omitted:
