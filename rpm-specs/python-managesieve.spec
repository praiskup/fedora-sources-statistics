This module allows accessing a Sieve-Server for managing Sieve scripts there.
It is accompanied by a simple yet functional user application ‘sieveshell’.

Summary:        %{summary}
# Package `cyrus-imapd-utils` also provides /usr/bin/sieveshell
# However `python-managesieve` provided a Python script installed at
# /usr/bin/sieveshell from its inception when version 0.6 was packaged
# in 2020. Upstream's HISTORY file documents it being present since 0.2
# released in 2004. Clearly this has been missed during package review.
