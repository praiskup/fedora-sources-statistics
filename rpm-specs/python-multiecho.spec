%global common_description %{expand:
MRI data acquisitions can involve multiple volumes acquired at different echo
times. Typically, subsequent processing pipelines assume data to be acquired at
a single echo time. This package provides a library and command-line tool to
combine multiple echoes from a multi-echo (BOLD f)MRI acquisition.}

# Remove the shebang from the multiecho.combination module; upstream seems to
# have intended it to be directly executable as a script when working on the
# source, but it will not be installed with the executable bit set, so the
# shebang is useless. When packaged, we have the entry point “mecombine”
# anyway.
