%global _description %{expand:
multiprocess is a fork of multiprocessing, and is developed as part of
pathos: https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos

multiprocessing is a package for the Python language which supports the
spawning of processes using the API of the standard library’s threading module.
multiprocessing has been distributed in the standard library since python 2.6.

Features:

- Objects can be transferred between processes using pipes or
  multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.
- Objects can be shared between processes using a server process or
  (for simple data) shared memory.
- Equivalents of all the synchronization primitives in threading are
  available.
- A Pool class makes it easy to submit tasks to a pool of worker
  processes.

multiprocess is part of pathos, a python framework for heterogeneous
computing. multiprocess is in active development, so any user feedback,
bug reports, comments, or suggestions are highly appreciated. A list of
issues is located at
https://github.com/uqfoundation/multiprocess/issues, with a legacy list
maintained at https://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos/query.}
