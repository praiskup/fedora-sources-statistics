%description
The NIX project started as an initiative within the Electrophysiology Task
Force a part of the INCF Data sharing Program. The NIX data model allows to
store fully annotated scientific data-set, i.e. the data together with its
metadata within the same container. Our aim is to achieve standardization by
providing a common/generic data structure for a multitude of data types. See
the wiki for more information

The current implementations store the actual data using the HDF5 file format as
a storage backend.
