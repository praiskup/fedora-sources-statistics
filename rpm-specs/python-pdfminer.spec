%global common_description %{expand:
Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner. It is a
tool for extracting information from PDF documents. It focuses on getting and
analyzing text data. Pdfminer.six extracts the text from a page directly from
the sourcecode of the PDF. It can also be used to get the exact location, font
or color of the text.

It is built in a modular way such that each component of pdfminer.six can be
replaced easily. You can implement your own interpreter or rendering device
that uses the power of pdfminer.six for other purposes than text analysis.

Check out the full documentation on Read the Docs
(https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io/).

Features:

  • Written entirely in Python.
  • Parse, analyze, and convert PDF documents.
  • PDF-1.7 specification support. (well, almost).
  • CJK languages and vertical writing scripts support.
  • Various font types (Type1, TrueType, Type3, and CID) support.
  • Support for extracting images (JPG, JBIG2, Bitmaps).
  • Support for various compressions (ASCIIHexDecode, ASCII85Decode, LZWDecode,
    FlateDecode, RunLengthDecode, CCITTFaxDecode)
  • Support for RC4 and AES encryption.
  • Support for AcroForm interactive form extraction.
  • Table of contents extraction.
  • Tagged contents extraction.
  • Automatic layout analysis.}

Summary:        %{summary}

# The import name is pdfminer. The upstream project name (as specified in
# setup.py) is pdfminer.six, which results in a canonical project name of
# pdfminer-six.
%py_provides python3-pdfminer-six

# One file, pdfminer/_saslprep.py, is forked from from ASL 2.0 code by MongoDB,
# Inc.—originally pymongo/saslprep.py in mongo-python-driver
# (python-pymongo)—with additional modifications in pyHanko (not yet packaged),
# where it is pyhanko/pdf_utils/_saslprep.py.
#
# Since this is a fork of the python-pymongo module, and since the fork is not
# part of pyHanko’s public API, there is no possibility of using an unbundled
# version.
#
# The version history of the fork is not clear. We add unversioned virtual
# Provides for both libraries of origin.
