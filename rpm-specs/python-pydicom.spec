%global _description %{expand:
pydicom is a pure python package for working with DICOM files. It was made for
inspecting and modifying DICOM data in an easy "pythonic" way. The
modifications can be written again to a new file.

pydicom is not a DICOM server, and is not primarily about viewing images. It is
designed to let you manipulate data elements in DICOM files with python code.

Limitations -- the main limitation of the current version is that compressed
pixel data (e.g. JPEG) cannot be altered in an intelligent way as it can for
uncompressed pixels. Files can always be read and saved, but compressed pixel
data cannot easily be modified.

Documentation is available at https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom}
