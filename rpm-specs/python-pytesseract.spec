%global _description %{expand:
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That
is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also
useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image
types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg,
png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script,
Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.}
