%global common_description %{expand:
This plugin produces coverage reports. Compared to just using coverage run this
plugin does some extras:

  • Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get
    covered without any fuss.
  • Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist’s features and still get
    coverage.
  • Consistent pytest behavior. If you run coverage run -m pytest you will have
    slightly different sys.path (CWD will be in it, unlike when running
    pytest).

All features offered by the coverage package should work, either through
pytest-cov’s command line options or through coverage’s config file.
