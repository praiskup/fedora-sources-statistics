%global _description %{expand:
pytest-lsp is a pytest plugin for writing end-to-end tests for language servers.

It works by running the language server in a subprocess and communicating with
it over stdio, just like a real language client. This also means pytest-lsp can
be used to test language servers written in any language - not just Python.

pytest-lsp relies on the pygls library for its language server protocol
implementation.}
