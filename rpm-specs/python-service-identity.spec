%global common_description %{expand:
Use this package if you use pyOpenSSL and donâ€™t want to be MITMed, or if you
want to verify that a PyCA cryptography certificate is valid for a certain
hostname or IP address.  service-identity aspires to give you all the tools you
need for verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.
In the simplest case, this means host name verification.  However,
service-identity implements RFC 6125 fully and plans to add other relevant RFCs
too.}
