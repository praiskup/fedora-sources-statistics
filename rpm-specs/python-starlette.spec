BuildRequires:  python3-devel
# The file requirements.txt pins exact versions and contains many unwanted
# dependencies, e.g. linters and typecheckers (see
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#_linters).
# It’s easier to maintain BuildRequires for testing manually than to heavily
# patch or process the requirements file.
