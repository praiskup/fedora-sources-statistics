%description
SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed specifically to
represent the entire contents of a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file in an
editable form. Thus, SNGs representing elaborate graphics images and ancillary
chunk data can be readily generated or modified using only text tools.

SNG is implemented by a compiler/decompiler called sng that losslessly
translates between SNG and PNG.
