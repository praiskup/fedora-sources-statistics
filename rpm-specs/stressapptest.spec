%description
Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) is a memory
interface test. It tries to maximize randomized traffic to memory from
processor and I/O, with the intent of creating a realistic high load situation
in order to test the existing hardware devices in a computer. It has been used
at Google for some time and now it is available under the Apache 2.0 license.
