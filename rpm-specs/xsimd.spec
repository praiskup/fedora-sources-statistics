%global _description \
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a feature of microprocessors that \
has been available for many years. SIMD instructions perform a single operation \
on a batch of values at once, and thus provide a way to significantly \
accelerate code execution. However, these instructions differ between \
microprocessor vendors and compilers. \
 \
xsimd provides a unified means for using these features for library authors. \
Namely, it enables manipulation of batches of numbers with the same arithmetic \
operators as for single values. It also provides accelerated implementation \
of common mathematical functions operating on batches. \
