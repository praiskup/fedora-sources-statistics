# Setting BUILD_PYTHON_MODULE builds a Python extension shared library module,
# but we don’t get any metadata (dist-info), so it’s not terribly useful for
# packaging purposes. Instead, it seems we must re-build the whole library
# through setuptools to get that.
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo prevents the build from stripping the
# python module after it is built.  The stripping happens in
# pybind11_add_module.

# CMake respects this environment variable. We need to see the compiler
# invocations to verify the distro build flags are respected. Unfortunately,
# pybind11 does add -O3, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to turn that off.
# It’s a global pybind11 decision, not something in this package’s sources.

# Now we do something sneaky: we substitute the Python extension that was built
# in the original CMake invocation, replacing the one built with setuptools. It
# is dynamically linked against the main libZXing.so, which makes it smaller,
# and it was not built with that pesky -O3 that was added by pybind11, so it
# better complies with packaging guidelines. The only problem is it contains an
# rpath that we need to remove.
